I want good research taste. The researchers I admire seem to have it. But I don't. It can feel isolating. Like I'm cut off from the fountain of knowledge. Not them. All tapped into the source. Bubbling with ideas. Grounded in truth. Grasping the future.

How to operationalize taste? Good taste is about asking the right questions. Interesting ones. Questions with surprising answers. Questions others wish they asked.
